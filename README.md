# ui-mm

A collection of [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org) mind maps to describe UI state transitions for *any* implementation of *open money* (although originally started for the NESTS implementation currently under development).

Each mind map represents one page/view.

This should be read in conjunction with https://openmoney.github.io/specification/

This is very much a work in progress, still in its early stages. Expect it to evolve significantly over the coming weeks.
